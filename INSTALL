== Database ==
Create a new database, import schema.sql, and make sure you have a user
with usage privileges for the database

add at least one car like this:
INSERT INTO `cars` SET `make`  = 'Ford',
                       `model` = 'Focus',
                       `hp`    = 112,
                       `plate` = 'X-EE 1111'


== PHP Config ==
create a symlink to the zend framework in includes/lib/
(includes/lib/Zend -> points to Zend)

open includes/bootstrap.php and find (somewhere near line 40): // init db
set the correct connect information for mysql

to make smarty works correctly make sure your php has write access to:
includes/lib/Smarty/compiled


== Run ==
put everything in some location that is accessible via http and call index.php
